# Project Alpha Version

## Overview
This is the Alpha version of our paddle-ball game project. It includes the core gameplay logic implemented using object-oriented design and the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Features in Alpha
- Ball movement and wall bounce
- Paddle controlled by mouse
- Collision detection between ball and paddle
- Score tracking
- Basic game reset

## Design Approach
- OOP classes: `Ball`, `Paddle`, and `Game`
- Game state is encapsulated in a single `Game` class
- Composition used to structure the application (no inheritance)
